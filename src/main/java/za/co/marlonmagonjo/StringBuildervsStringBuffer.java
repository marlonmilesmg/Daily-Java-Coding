     *
     * StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes, but String is immutable.
     * StringBuilder is not synchronised or thread-safe, whereas StringBuffer is. StringBuilder is quicker than StringBuffer because of this.
     * The StringBuffer or StringBuilder class is used internally by the string concatenation operator (+).
     *
     * StringBuilder is part of the Java standard library and is commonly used for building strings in an efficient way.
     * StringBuffer, on the other hand, is thread-safe, which means that multiple threads can access it simultaneously without compromising the integrity of the string.
     * StringBuilder is not thread-safe, so it is not recommended for use in multi-threaded environments.
     * However, in most cases, StringBuilder is sufficient for building strings in a efficient and safe manner.
