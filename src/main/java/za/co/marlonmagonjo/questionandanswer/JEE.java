/**
 *  Servlets
 *      HTTP-specific servlets allow developers to process data submitted by HTML forms. Servlets are Java classes that run on a web server and handle requests and responses in the HTTP protocol.
 *      When an HTML form is submitted, the data entered by the user is sent to the server as an HTTP request. Servlets can be used to receive and process this data.
 *      The servlet retrieves the form data from the request object and performs the necessary operations, such as storing the data in a database, performing calculations, or generating a response.
 *      Servlets provide methods that allow developers to access form data easily. For example, the doPost() method can be used to handle HTTP POST requests, which are commonly used for submitting form data.
 *      The servlet can extract the submitted data using methods like getParameter() to retrieve individual form fields or getParameterValues() to retrieve multiple values from checkboxes or select lists.
 *      By using servlets, developers can receive and process data submitted by HTML forms, perform server-side operations, and generate appropriate responses to the user.

 *  What is Java EE and what are its key components?
 *      Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) is a platform that provides a collection of specifications and APIs for developing enterprise-level, distributed, and scalable applications in Java. 
 *      It offers a robust and standardized framework for building enterprise software systems.
 *
 *      The key components of Java EE include:
 *
 *      1. Servlet: It is a Java class that handles HTTP requests and responses, providing a foundation for web application development.
 *
 *      2. JavaServer Pages (JSP): It is a technology that allows developers to embed Java code within HTML pages, facilitating dynamic web page generation.
 *
 *      3. JavaServer Faces (JSF): It is a component-based web framework that simplifies the development of user interfaces for web applications.
 *
 *      4. Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB): It is a server-side component model that enables the development of scalable and transactional business logic in enterprise applications. 
 *         EJBs can be of three types: session beans, entity beans, and message-driven beans.
 *
 *      5. Java Persistence API (JPA): It is a specification that provides a standardized way to manage persistent data using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques. 
 *         JPA simplifies the interaction between Java objects and relational databases.
 *
 *      6. Java Message Service (JMS): It is an API that enables Java applications to send, receive, and process messages asynchronously, promoting loose coupling and reliable communication between distributed components.
 *
 *      7. Java Transaction API (JTA): It provides a standard interface for managing distributed transactions across multiple resources, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
 *
 *      8. Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI): It allows Java applications to access naming and directory services, such as LDAP, to locate and access various resources, such as databases and messaging services.
 *
 *      9. JavaMail: It is an API for sending and receiving email messages using Java.
 *
 *      10. Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS): It provides a framework for user authentication and authorization in Java applications, supporting various authentication mechanisms and access control policies.
 *
 *      These components work together to provide a comprehensive and standardized platform for building enterprise applications in Java.
