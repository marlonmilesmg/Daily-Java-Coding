/**
 *
 * Spring and Hibernate are both popular frameworks used in Java development, but they serve different purposes and address different aspects of building applications. Here's a brief explanation of the difference between the two:
 *
 * 1. **Spring:**
 *    - Spring is a comprehensive and modular framework for Java applications, providing support for building various types of applications, including web applications, RESTful services, and more.
 *    - It follows the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle, which means it manages the dependencies of an application and allows components to be loosely coupled, making the application more maintainable and testable.
 *    - Spring provides a wide range of features, including data access, security, transaction management, dependency injection, and more, through its various modules like Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data, etc.
 *    - It can work with any data access technology, not just Hibernate, and gives developers the flexibility to choose the best ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for their needs.
 *
 * 2. **Hibernate:**
 *    - Hibernate is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It allows developers to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa, making database operations more object-oriented.
 *    - The primary goal of Hibernate is to handle database interactions and abstract the underlying SQL operations. It manages the mapping between Java classes and database tables, as well as the data retrieval, storage, and manipulation processes.
 *    - By using Hibernate, developers can focus more on business logic and object-oriented design rather than dealing with low-level SQL queries.
 *    - While Hibernate is an excellent ORM tool, it does not provide other features that Spring offers, such as dependency injection, transaction management, security, etc.
 *
 * In summary, Spring is a broader framework that offers various components to build entire Java applications, while Hibernate is specifically focused on simplifying database interactions through ORM capabilities.
 * They can complement each other, and it's common to see them used together in Java projects to take advantage of their respective strengths.
