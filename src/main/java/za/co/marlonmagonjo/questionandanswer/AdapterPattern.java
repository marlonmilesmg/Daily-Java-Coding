/**
 *  Adapter pattern is a behavioral design pattern.
 *  It is used to convert the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect.
 *  This pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a bridge between them.
 *  The Adapter pattern is often used when integrating new or existing code that cannot be directly modified to meet the interface requirements of other code.
 *  By using an adapter, the two incompatible interfaces can communicate and interact with each other.
