 *  There are several advantages of using Gradle over Maven:
 *      1. Flexibility and Extensibility: Gradle offers more flexibility and extensibility compared to Maven.
 *          Gradle uses a Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language), which allows developers to write custom scripts and
 *          define build logic in a more concise and expressive manner.
 *          This flexibility enables Gradle to handle complex build requirements and allows for easier customization.
 *
 *      2. Performance: Gradle is known for its improved build performance. It uses an incremental build model,
 *          which means it only builds the necessary parts of a project that have changed, reducing the overall build time.
 *          Gradle also benefits from its highly optimized dependency management system, which can make dependency resolution faster and more efficient.
 *
 *      3. Build Scripting: Gradle build scripts are written in Groovy or Kotlin, which are powerful programming languages.
 *          This allows developers to write logic and perform complex tasks directly in the build script,
 *          making it easier to automate various build processes and integrate with other tools or frameworks.
 *
 *      4. Dependency Management: Gradle provides more advanced dependency management capabilities compared to Maven.
 *          It supports multiple dependency repositories, including Maven Central, JCenter, and custom repositories.
 *          Gradle also allows finer control over dependency configurations, making it easier to manage transitive dependencies and exclude specific dependencies if needed.
 *
 *      5. Incremental Builds: Gradle has better support for incremental builds, meaning it can intelligently determine which parts of the project need to be recompiled
 *          or rebuilt based on changes since the last build. This feature helps to significantly reduce build times for large projects, especially during development and continuous integration processes.
 *
 *      6. Android Development: Gradle is the default build system for Android projects. It offers extensive support for building, testing, and packaging Android applications.
 *          Gradle's Android plugin provides features like multi-module builds, resource merging, and product flavor management, making it a preferred choice for Android development.
 *
 *      7. Community and Ecosystem: Gradle has a growing and active community, and it is becoming increasingly popular among developers.
 *          It has a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions, which provide additional functionality and integration with various tools and frameworks.
 *          This vibrant ecosystem contributes to the availability of resources, documentation, and community support for Gradle users.
 *
 *  While both Gradle and Maven are powerful build tools, Gradle's flexibility, performance, and advanced features make it a compelling choice for many developers and organizations.
 *  However, the choice between Gradle and Maven ultimately depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the project or team.
