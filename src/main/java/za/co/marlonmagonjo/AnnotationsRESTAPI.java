 * @RestController - is a specialized version of the controller.
 * It includes the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations, and as a result, simplifies the controller implementation.
 * The controller is annotated with the @RestController annotation; therefore, the @ResponseBody isn't required.
 * Every request handling method of the controller class automatically serializes return objects into HttpResponse.
 *
 * @RequestMapping - the annotation is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods.
 *
 * @GetMapping
 *
 * @PostMapping
 *
 * @PutMapping
 *
 * @DeleteMapping
 *
 * @RequestBody
 *
 * @PathVariable
 *
 * @RequestParam
 *
 * @ControllerAdvice
 *
 * @ExceptionHandler
